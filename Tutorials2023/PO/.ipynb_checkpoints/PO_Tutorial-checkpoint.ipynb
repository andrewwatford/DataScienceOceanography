    "This tutorial is part of our Physical Oceanography day. It demonstrates how to do basic analysis and visualization of gridded oceanic and atmospheric data. We will use the so-called reanalysis data, a modeled estimate of how the ocean and atmosphere have evolved over the past several decades. This data has been downloaded using Copernicus API, a giant data database for Earth system observations and modeling. See the readme.txt and the download_era.py script for instructions on downloading the data -- it is very simple to do once you see an example. \n",

    "\n",
    "- ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. We will use just a few of its two-dimensional variables, including the sea surface temperature (SST), atmospheric precipitation, surface pressure and winds, as well as the 2 meter air temperature.  The ERA5 data was pre-downloaded using the Copernicus API: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to. The download_era.py script gets this data:  https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means-preliminary-back-extension?tab=form\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you download the  data, there will be an .nc file that is loded and analysed in ENSO.ipynb (the data has already been downloaded so no need to re-download it unless you need extra variables). To speed up the analysis, we coarsened the dataset from 1/4 degree to a 1 degree grid and saved it as __ERA5_Coarse.nc__\n",

    "Instructions:\n",
    " - use xarray's .groupby(\"time.month\") option to group the original dataset by months first before subtracting from it the climatology; xarray figures out how to properly broadcast the arrays of different dimensions\n",
    " - name the anomaly array as __era_a__ and select the time of the El Nino event before plotting a map. \n",
    " - add to the plot the box of the so-called Nino3.4 index: an area of the tropical Pacific ocean where SST is strongly responding to ENSO events. The Nino34 box is bounded by latitude (-5,5) degrees and by longitude (190,240) degrees. You can use the plt.plot to add it, by specifying the coordinates of the box. Make sure to check that the box is in the right place!"
