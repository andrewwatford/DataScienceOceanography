    "This tutorial is part of our Chemical Oceanography day. It demonstrates how to do basic analysis and visualization of chemical element observations in the ocean. The biogeochemical observations on oceanographic research cruises are commonly collected using a Rosette. It is a framework with many sampling bottles clustered around a central cylinder, where other continuous sensor packages can be attached. We'll access typical observations collected via Rosette casts using a variety of methods and try to verify a few fundamental oceanographic principles. \n",

    "Oxygen is input into the ocean at the surface, through the processes of photosynthesis by phytoplankton and mixing with the atmosphere. However, organisms, both microbial and multicellular, use oxygen in respiration throughout the entire depth of the ocean, so when the supply of oxygen from the surface is less than the utilization of oxygen in deep water, oxygen loss occurs. This phenomenon is natural, but is exacerbated with increased stratification and/or temperature. Stratification occurs when water masses with different properties, primarily temperature and salinity, are layered, with lower density water on top of higher density water. The larger the differences in the properties between layers, the less mixing occurs between the layers. Stratification is increased when the temperature of the surface ocean or the amount of freshwater input into the ocean from rivers and ice melt increases, enhancing ocean deoxygenation by limiting supply. Another factor that can limit supply is the solubility of oxygen. As temperature and salinity increase, the solubility of oxygen decreases, meaning that less oxygen can be dissolved into water as it warms and becomes more salty.\n",

    "Ocean deoxygenation is an additional stressor on marine life, posing a threat to fish and other types of marine life, as well as to people who depend on marine life for nutrition or livelihood. Total ocean oxygen content has decreased by 1-2% since 1960. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_deoxygenation\n",

    "#### Fun historical note: \n",
    "The term \"t-statistic\" is abbreviated from \"hypothesis test statistic\". The T-Distribution, also known as Student's t-distribution, gets its name from William Sealy Gosset who first published it in English in 1908 in the scientific journal Biometrika using his pseudonym \"Student\" because his employer preferred staff to use pen names when publishing scientific papers instead of their real name, so he used the name \"Student\" to hide his identity. Gosset worked at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Ireland, and was interested in the problems of small samples â€“ for example, the chemical properties of barley with small sample sizes. Hence a second version of the etymology of the term Student is that Guinness did not want their competitors to know that they were using the t-test to determine the quality of raw material. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test"

    "Phytoplankton require a suite of chemicals, and those with the potential to be scarce in surface waters are typically identified as \"nutrients.\" Calcium is an example of an element that is rapidly assimilated by some plankton (for production of calcium carbonate \"hard parts\") but is not typically considered a nutrient because of its uniformly high concentration in seawater. Dissolved inorganic carbon, which is the feedstock for organic carbon production by photosynthesis, is also abundant and so is not typically listed among the nutrients. However, its acidic form dissolved CO$_2$ is often at adequately low concentrations to affect the growth of at least some phytoplankton.\n",

Redfield who in 1934 first described the relatively consistent ratio of nutrients in marine biomass samples collected across several voyages on board the research vessel Atlantis, and empirically found the ratio to be C:N:P = 106:16:1. While deviations from the canonical 106:16:1 ratio have been found depending on phytoplankton species and the study area, the Redfield ratio has remained an important reference to oceanographers studying nutrient limitation. A 2014 paper summarizing a large data set of nutrient measurements across all major ocean regions spanning from 1970 to 2010 reported the global median C:N:P to be 163:22:1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfield_ratio\n",
